Dear prospective students,<p>

Thank you for your interest in pursuing a PhD under my supervision. Due to the high volume of inquiries, please fill out <a href="prospective_student.docx">this table</a> and include it in the body of your email. This not only helps me review your email efficiently but also saves you the effort of writing a lengthy cover letter.<p>

Please attach your CV and other relevant materials such as Bachelor/Master's transcripts, TOEFL/IELTS/GRE score sheets, and representative publications.<p>

Additionally, while many applicants focus on ML/AI, I also encourage those with strong knowledge and experience in IoT or cybersecurity to apply.<p>

Best of luck,<p>

Thomas Luo
