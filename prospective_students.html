Dear prospective students,<p>

Thank you for your interest in pursuing your PhD degree with me. Unfortunately, the large number of such emails often prevents me from reading your email carefully. Therefore, to streamline this process, I request you to please fill out <a href="prospective_student.docx">this table</a> and insert it into your email <i>body</i> (not as an attachment). This would actually make your task of email writing much easier.<p>

In your attachment, feel free to include your CV and other materials (if any) such as GRE/TOEFL/IELTS score sheets, transcripts, publications, etc.<p>

Final note: <b>Too many</b> candiates are interested in ML/AI, but those who have strong background in <b>IoT</b> and/or <b>cybersecurity</b> are strongly encouraged to apply to my group!<p>

I wish all of you the best of luck.<p>

Tony T. Luo
