Dear prospective students,<p>

Thank you for your interest in pursuing your PhD with me. Unfortunately, I have been receiving too many such emails and I can barely afford reading them all. Therefore, to streamline this process, please fill out <a href="prospective_student.docx">this table</a> and insert it into your email <i>body</i> (not as attachment). This will ensure that I read your email and also save your time on writing a long cover letter.<p>

In your email, please also attach: your CV, transcripts, publications (if available), and anything else you'd like.<p>

Although I cannot guarantee replying all of your emails, ping me again after a week of silence if you do think you are a strong candidate.<p>

Best,<br>

Tony T. Luo
