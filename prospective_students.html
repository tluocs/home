Dear prospective students,<p>

Thank you for your interest in pursuing your PhD degree with my group. Unfortunately, the large volume of such emails often prevent me from reading your email closely. Therefore, to streamline this process, please fill out <a href="prospective_student.docx">this table</a> and copy it into your email <i>body</i> (not as an attachment). This not only allows me to read your email efficiently, but also saves <i>your</i> time from writing a lengthy cover letter. :)<p>

In your attachment, please include your CV and other materials such as BS/MS transcripts, GRE/TOEFL/IELTS score sheets, representative papers, etc.<p>

On a side note, <b>too many</b> applicants are interested in ML/AI (only), but I especially prefer and encourage those who have research experience in <b>IoT</b> and/or <b>cybersecurity</b> to apply to my group.<p>

I wish all of you the best of luck.<p>

Tony T. Luo
