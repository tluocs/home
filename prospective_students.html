Dear prospective students,<p>

Thank you for your interest in pursuing your PhD degree with me. Unfortunately, the large volume of such emails often prevents me from reading your email closely. Therefore, to streamline this process, please fill out <a href="prospective_student.docx">this table</a> and copy it into your email <i>body</i> (not as an attachment). This not only allows me to read your email efficiently, but also saves <i>your</i> time from writing a lengthy cover letter. :)<p>

In your attachment, please include your CV and other materials such as BS/MS transcripts, GRE/TOEFL/IELTS score sheets, representative papers, etc.<p>

On a related note, there have been <b>too many</b> applicants who are only interested in ML/AI, but I want to especially encourage those who have sound knowledge and experience in <b>IoT</b> or <b>cybersecurity</b> to apply to my group.<p>

Wishing you the best of luck.<p>

Tony T. Luo
