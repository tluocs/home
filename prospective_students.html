Dear prospective students,<p>

Thank you for your interest in pursuing your PhD with me. Unfortunately, I have been receiving too many such emails and I can barely afford reading them all. Therefore, to streamline this process, please fill in <a href="prospective_student.docx">this table</a> and insert it into your email <i>body</i> (not as attachment). This will ensure that I read your email and also save your time on writing a cover letter.<p>

In your email, please also attach: your CV, transcripts (if available), and anything else you'd like to.<p>

I cannot guarantee replying all of your emails, but if you think you are a strong candidate and do not receive my reply after a week, please ping me again (sometimes Outlook mistakenly sweeps emails into the spam folder).<p>

I wish you the best of luck!<p>

Tony T. Luo
