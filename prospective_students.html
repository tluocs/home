Dear prospective students,<p>

Thank you for your interest in pursuing your PhD degree with me. Unfortunately, the large number of such emails often prevents me from reading them all. To streamline this process, I request you to please fill out <a href="prospective_student.docx">this table</a> and insert it into your email <i>body</i> (not as attachment). Additionally, you can attach your CV and supplementary materials such as transcripts, publications (if any), etc.<p>

I believe using that table could actually make your job of writing a cover letter easier. :) <p>

Best,<br>

Tony T. Luo
